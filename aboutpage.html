            In 2023, the Laura Fergusson Brain Injury Trust secured a 12-month
            Lotteries Grant to establish a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Peer &
            Whānau Support Service. The Trust has a long history of providing
            rehabilitation and residential support for individuals with TBI,
            ranging from concussion to severe, long-term injuries.

          <p>
            Those affected by TBI, along with their families, often experience
            feelings of isolation, frustration with slow recovery progress, and
            a sense of being misunderstood. This service aims to provide support
            from people who have lived through similar experiences.
          </p>

            Our goal is to build a diverse network of volunteers from various
            age groups and backgrounds throughout the Canterbury region. Whether
            it’s a phone call, a text, or a coffee meet-up, we strive to match
            people with someone who truly understands their challenges.
          </p>

          <p>
            The support offered can vary based on individual needs – from a
            weekly check-in to as-needed support. We are committed to making
            sure everyone finds the right fit for sharing practical experiences
            and receiving emotional support.
