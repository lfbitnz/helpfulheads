          <h2>Peer Support</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to our free Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Peer Support
            Service, designed to assist those living with TBI, whether mild,
            moderate, or severe, as well as their supporters.
          </p>

          <h2>What is Peer Support?</h2>
          <p>
            Peer Support is a process where individuals use their own
            experiences to help others, offering knowledge, emotional support,
            social interaction, or practical assistance. Living with a brain
            injury, including concussions, can be an isolating experience, often
            leading to feelings of being misunderstood.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Helpful Heads, we connect individuals with volunteers who have
            personal experience with brain injuries, either through their own
            recovery or by supporting someone close to them. Our volunteers are
            eager to support others on similar journeys, offering a unique
            understanding and empathy that only comes from shared experience.
